This is a project that demonstrates the crucial role of databases in order to store and search data efficiently. 
I created a problem description of a student library based on my personal experience as a student at University of Patras. That is a very good example of an institution that needs perfect data management in order to avoid mistakes and provide excellent services to the users. 
The library consists of many entities such as books, rooms, employees, suppliers, students etc, each with it's own attributes.
At first, I try to express all the realtionships/cardinality between the entities, using an ER diagram and then I create the database schema where all the necessary tables and keys are defined.
After that, I insert imaginary data into each table such as book titles, book authors, student names in order to make the problem as realistic as possible.
Having all set, I come up with 24 problems/questions related to specific database information i.e how many books are written in english. To answer these questions is required thorough search into the database.  
Finally I write all the SQL queries to answer these problems.

The tools used are: VScode, MySQL server as the RDBMS and the SQL language.
