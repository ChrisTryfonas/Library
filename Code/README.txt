The database is created using MySQL Command Line Client. 
After that step I do the following actions :
1) Build the database schema which means to define the arrays, their attrubutes and the data types (Schema.sql)
2) Insert the data to each array (Insert.sql).
3) Write the necessary queries to answer the problems-questions and find the needed information (Queries.sql).

The codes in this folder perform these 3 steps.
